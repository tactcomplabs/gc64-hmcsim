HMC-SIM TODO LIST
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- decode bank to dram association 

- add function to simulate "clock"
  -- in progress: need to finish the xbar section; then add the finish the top-level stages
  -- S1:	done
  -- S2: 	done
  -- S3:	done
  -- S4:	finish hmcsim_process_rqst : add dram handlers to each command block
  -- S5:	done
  -- S5a:	done
  -- S6:	done
  -- look for 'todo'

-- finish hmc_reset_device

-- finish the packet processor 
  - make sure and pay attention to the SLID value in the tail 
    for response routing
  - go back through the response routing and make sure this is true 
  - probably done; but make sure 

- add warm reset function for JTAG requests

- add size to the build_memrequest for the payload 
  -- maybe not, investigate

- revise the link structure per page 19 of the spec; 
  -- child device links are configured as host links to go upstream; 
  -- parent links are configured as pass-thru's; 
  -- possible mark devices as being connected to real host or uplink
  -- i think we're good here, but double check 

- future optimization
  -- keep lists of root devices & child devices

- add cache analysis functions


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Completed Items:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- util function to determine if device is attached to a host [eg root device]
  -- DONE

- revise physical address decoding : see Table 9: Pg 31
  -- DONE: this means fixing all the decode_vault logic
  -- DONE: add a decode_quad function
  -- DONE: wrap everything up with a top-level function: decode_qv
  -- DONE: make sure all the functions in hmc_clock are correct now

-- finish the hmc_bank_conflict code
  -- DONE: make sure and mark the conflicts with HMC_RQST_CONFLICT
  -- DONE: make sure and figure out the packet type

- add functions to simplify writing the max request width
  -- only support for default addressing modes
  -- DONE : Checkin 119
- add queue reorg function to hmc_clock
  -- DONE
- finalize the bank conflict methdology in hmc_clock_bank_conflicts from hmc_clock.c
  -- look at the total number of banks and use that as the sliding window of possible values
  -- DONE
- update the host device cub id to be represented as num_devices+1
  -- DONE
- build funtions to send/recv packets
  -- DONE
- build functions to dump trace info 
  -- DONE
- build internal routing info for dev to dev xfers
  -- DONE: handled in hmcsim_clock
- add functions and handlers for HMC internal registers  
-- 1) add handlers for request MODE_READ MODE_WRITE packets
-- 2) add side-band functions to access registers 
   -- DONE
-- 3) add macros to decode the spec's notion of a register index versus the internal 
      representation 
   -- DONE
-- 4) add auto setup of config regs within the hmc_init() function 
   -- DONE
-- 5) add to header file 
   -- DONE
- fix case where we have eight quads and four vaults; set pointers accordingly
   -- DONE
- add default config register writing for hmc_init(..) function; 
  -- DONE
- write the feature and version register
  -- do this as a part of configuring the devices
  -- DONE
- fix vault layout in init : see page 31
  -- DONE
